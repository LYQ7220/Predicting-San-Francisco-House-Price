# Predicting-San-Francisco-House-Price

Overview
Prediction of house price is always a popular topic for the public. In this project, I utilize data from Github to predict the house price in San Francisco during 2015 and 2018 with two different models, time series model(ARIMA) and machine learning model (linear regression). By comparison of two models, we can have a more comprehensive understanding of house price in San Francisco.
